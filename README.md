## Description

This GlotPress plugin allows you to add icons to your projects.

Up to GlotPress v4.0.1 the templates 'project.php' and 'projects.php' don't have the necessary hooks to easily add the icons on server side.

For now the icons are added on the frontend with JavaScript.

If the PR [Add action hooks and filters to Projects and Project templates](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress/pull/1864) is merged, then the JS is no longer needed and the template customization will be done the right way.

The plugin uses `gp_meta` with the meta key `project_icon` to store the ID of the media library attachment, for each object of type `project` with a corresponding ID.

## Features

* GlotPress projects page:
  * Icons on the left of the project names.
* GlotPress project page:
  * Header icon above the project title.
  * Icons on the left of the sub-project names.
* GlotPress project edit/new form:
  * Media file select field to choose an image from the media library.

## Known issues

* Currently, GlotPress still does not delete meta when deleting a project, leading to orphaned meta.
* GlotPress does not clone the meta when branching a project, so any cloned projects do not inherit its icon.

## Requirements

* GlotPress v4.0.
